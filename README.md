### Logistic Regression Binary Classifier
This project demonstrates a simple binary classification task using **Logistic Regression** on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Scikit-learn. The workflow includes loading the dataset, splitting it into training and test sets, standardizing the features, and fitting a logistic regression model. The model is evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. Additionally, a ROC curve is plotted to visualize the model's performance. The implementation uses Python libraries including Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
